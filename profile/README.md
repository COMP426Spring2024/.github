# COMP 426: Modern Web Programming

Developing applications for the World Wide Web including both client-side and server-side programming. Emphasis on Model-View-Controller architecture, AJAX, RESTful Web services, and database interaction. 

Web application architectures have advanced considerably with the advent of AJAX-based web services and backends. This course will cover the key technologies underlying a modern HTML5 web application including HTTP, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, Node.js, Angular, and React. We'll take a close look at the JavaScript as a functional language and its prototype-based object model.
